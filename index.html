<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Faizah Muhammad I was born in Long Island , New York but raised in Richmond , Virginia. I've always been creative and determined to get the things I want, and parents can't get you what you want all of the time so I'd have to work for it and get it myself, even from a young age I’d do this. I would color pictures and sell them. As I got older I would make magnets, cookies, bracelets , and necklaces or whatever I could think of and sell them around the neighborhood and to my parents' friends. All the practice of selling things and dealing with people I was getting over time, helped me with my “first job”. My mom has a business selling zucchini bread and we would go to vending fairs and markets to sell our product and I would be the one running the everything, setting up our stand, collecting money, giving change, explaining prices etc. My next job was working with my dad he owns a gym, is a personal trainer, and sells workout clothes. My role in all this is putting his and other trainers clients payment information in the new systems, also sorting folders, answering emails and packaging orders.
